# `fastmd-platform-windows` Validation Notes

Reference surface:

- `apps/macos`

Stage 2 target locked by this crate:

- Windows 11
- Explorer

This validation file is crate-local evidence only. It does not claim full Windows parity and it does not replace the Stage 2 layer gates.

## Implemented in this slice

- buildable Rust library crate created
- Windows 11 + Explorer-only target encoded in crate docs and constants
- macOS reference behavior encoded as crate-local parity metadata
- authoritative Windows frontmost API stack encoded as `GetForegroundWindow`, `GetWindowThreadProcessId`, `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`, `GetClassNameW`, `IShellWindows`, and `IWebBrowserApp::HWND`
- stable Explorer surface identity encoded as matched shell HWND plus owner process id instead of a generic foreground-window check
- live Windows-only frontmost probing wired through PowerShell-backed foreground-window, process-image, class-name, and ShellWindows HWND collection calls
- non-Explorer foreground windows now rejected by the same strict process/class/shell-identity classifier that the live probe feeds
- authoritative Windows hovered-item API stack encoded as UI Automation `ElementFromPoint`, `ControlViewWalker`, `AutomationElement.Current.Name`, `IShellWindows`, `IWebBrowserApp::HWND`, `Folder.ParseName`, and `FolderItem.Path`
- live Windows-only hovered-item probing wired through a PowerShell UI Automation hit-test plus Explorer shell-window path reconstruction
- exact-item and hovered-row descendant evidence accepted; nearby or first-visible fallbacks explicitly rejected before preview open
- crate-local local `.md` acceptance filtering now runs inside the Explorer hovered-item pipeline and rejects relative paths, missing paths, directories, unsupported entities, and non-Markdown extensions
- authoritative Windows coordinate API stack encoded as `Cursor.Position`, `Screen.AllScreens`, `Screen.Bounds`, `Screen.WorkingArea`, and `SystemInformation.VirtualScreen`
- live Windows-only monitor probing wired through PowerShell-backed `System.Windows.Forms` monitor enumeration plus cursor capture
- Windows top-left desktop coordinates now translate into the shared y-up desktop space before they reach shared core placement logic
- `Screen.WorkingArea` is now preserved as the Windows equivalent of the macOS `visibleFrame` contract in shared monitor metadata
- monitor selection now prefers the containing translated work area and falls back to the nearest work area via shared-core monitor selection helpers
- `WindowsPreviewLoop` now wires frontmost Explorer gating, exact hovered-item resolution, and translated monitor selection into `fastmd_core::observe_hover`
- probe-driven preview-loop tests now cover the 1-second hover open debounce, blocked open while a non-Explorer surface is frontmost, stationary same-item no-reopen, replacement only after a different resolved Markdown target, and same-document pointer motion without dismissal
- `WindowsPreviewLoop::dispatch_command` now routes shared Stage 2 commands into `fastmd_core`, so Windows width-tier changes reuse the same shared macOS-parity semantics instead of a crate-local fork
- probe-driven preview-loop tests now prove that Windows width-tier changes emit the same 560 / 960 / 1440 / 1920 requests as macOS, preserve 4:3 aspect ratio, reposition before shrinking on roomy work areas, and only shrink once the requested tier truly cannot fit the selected work area
- shared contracts now publish one authoritative macOS preview feature list, shared core and render publish the features they own, and `windows_preview_loop_feature_coverage` proves the Windows preview loop covers that entire reference list without claiming real-machine evidence that has not been gathered yet
- shared render-side validation now pins `ui/src/markdown.ts`, `ui/src/styles.css`, and `ui/src/app.ts` to the same macOS Markdown runtime, explicit heading/paragraph/emphasis/strong parity references, styling, block-wrapper, and content-base wiring that the Windows preview shell consumes
- `WindowsValidationEvidenceReport` now turns the existing live frontmost, hover, coordinate, and automated feature-coverage outputs into one markdown report that can be captured on a real Windows 11 machine without hand-editing evidence files
- the generated validation report now emits explicit Layer 6 closure readiness plus ready/blocked checklist summaries, and it keeps the remaining parity-evidence checklist item blocked until the live frontmost, hover, and coordinate sections all pass
- the generated validation report now lists the automated proof lane for every macOS reference feature so reviewers can see whether the parity claim is coming from shared core, shared render, or the Windows adapter instead of inferring that ownership by hand
- a Windows-only `windows_validation_report` example now probes the live Explorer surface, current pointer target, and translated monitor layout, then prints a report that maps directly onto the remaining real-machine Layer 6 evidence items
- unit tests added for hover API-stack metadata, probe-output parsing, exact-vs-fallback evidence classification, adapter wiring, relative-path rejection, and stable-surface classification behavior
- unit tests added for coordinate API-stack metadata, Windows-to-shared desktop-space translation, containing-monitor selection, and nearest-work-area fallback
- unit tests added for frontmost-surface preservation when Explorer gating fails, shared-contract Windows surface round-trips, and shared-core Explorer hover-open semantics
- unit tests added for evidence-report status mapping, markdown rendering, and macOS reference feature enumeration inside the generated report

## Still pending

- validation evidence on a real Windows 11 machine for frontmost gating, exact hovered-item resolution, and multi-monitor coordinate handling
- reviewed Windows-specific evidence proving one-to-one parity with macOS across the Layer 6 feature list

## Verification commands

Run from the repository root:

```bash
cargo check --manifest-path crates/fastmd-platform-windows/Cargo.toml
```

Crate-local tests:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path crates/fastmd-platform-windows/Cargo.toml
```

Real Windows 11 evidence capture:

```bash
cargo run -p fastmd-platform-windows --example windows_validation_report > Docs/Test_Logs/windows11-explorer-validation-YYYYMMDD.md
```

Run the evidence capture on an actual Windows 11 machine with Explorer frontmost, the pointer resting on a local `.md` item, and the target monitor arrangement already in place. The generated markdown is evidence only; it does not automatically close any blueprint checklist item until the report is reviewed and checked into the authoritative docs lane.

## Actual results in this worker clone

- `rustup run stable-aarch64-apple-darwin rustfmt crates/fastmd-platform-windows/src/evidence.rs`: passed
- `rustup run stable-aarch64-apple-darwin cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps`: passed
- `rustup run stable-aarch64-apple-darwin cargo test -p fastmd-platform-windows --lib`: blocked before crate tests ran because the local Rosetta linker environment aborted inside `cc` with `Attachment of code signature supplement failed: 1` while compiling dependency build scripts
