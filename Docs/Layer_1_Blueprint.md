# FastMD Layer 1 Blueprint

This document is the single execution checklist for FastMD.

## Fixed Product Defaults

These are locked for Layer 1 and do not need further debate:

- Layer 1 app form: macOS menu bar app
- Layer 1 host surface: Finder only
- Layer 1 supported Finder view: list view first
- Layer 1 trigger: hover over local `.md` file for 1 second
- Layer 1 permission model: Accessibility only
- Layer 1 preview rendering: Markdown -> HTML -> `WKWebView`
- Layer 1 preview behavior: auto-show near cursor, auto-hide on move-away/app switch/Escape
- Layer 1 packaging target: installable local `.app`

## Closed-Loop End State

Layer 1 is done only when all of the following are true on the same machine:

1. FastMD launches as a menu bar app.
2. Finder is frontmost in list view.
3. Mouse hovers over a visible local `.md` file item for 1 second.
4. FastMD resolves the hovered Finder item to a real file path.
5. FastMD reads the file and renders readable preview content.
6. FastMD shows a floating preview panel near the cursor.
7. Moving the cursor away, switching apps, or pressing Escape closes the preview.
8. The loop can be repeated across many files without restarting the app.
