# FastMD Layer 1 Blueprint

This document is the single execution checklist for FastMD.

## Fixed Product Defaults

These are locked for Layer 1 and do not need further debate:

- Layer 1 app form: macOS menu bar app
- Layer 1 host surface: Finder only
- Layer 1 supported Finder view: list view first
- Layer 1 trigger: hover over local `.md` file for 1 second
- Layer 1 permission model: Accessibility only
- Layer 1 preview rendering: Markdown -> HTML -> `WKWebView`
- Layer 1 preview behavior: auto-show near cursor, replace only when a different hovered `.md` resolves, close on outside click/app switch/Escape
- Layer 1 packaging target: installable local `.app`

## Mandatory Clarifications From Live Testing

These are mandatory Layer 1 requirements and must be treated as non-optional checklist items:

- The resolver must open the actually hovered `.md` row in Finder list view and must not fall back to the first visible `.md` in the list when multiple Markdown files are present.
- The preview must stay visible during ordinary mouse movement within Finder; it must close only when a different Markdown file replaces it, when the user clicks outside the preview, when Finder loses focus, or when Escape is pressed.
- The full hover-to-preview loop must work on both the built-in display and external displays. Multi-display coordinate conversion for AX hit-testing and preview placement is a required part of Layer 1, not a later enhancement.
- The Markdown preview must cover a practical minimum syntax surface, including multi-level headings, emphasis, strong text, tables, syntax-highlighted fenced code blocks, Mermaid diagrams, math formulas, and other core readability blocks listed in Layer 1I.
- The preview panel must support four explicit width tiers, with the current width shown by default at the narrowest tier, the widest tier reaching 1920 pixels with a 1920:1440 4:3 target size, and left/right arrow hotkeys for stepwise width changes while the preview is hot.
- The preview must support inline block editing: double-clicking a rendered block enters edit mode for the smallest source Markdown block that produced it, the editor must show the original Markdown source for that block, saving must write back to the file and return to preview mode, and edit mode must lock the panel against hover replacement or outside-click dismissal until the edit is completed or canceled.
- Preview typography must stay readable at the narrowest width tier using a smaller fixed text scale rather than adaptive enlargement.
- The inline editor must align left, use about 60 percent of the current preview width, and size its edit box height to match the rendered block height it replaces.
- Preview placement may stay cursor-biased, but the selected width and height for the current tier have higher priority than keeping the popup's starting corner near the cursor. If the selected size still fits within the current screen, the popup must preserve that size and move position instead of shrinking. If the selected size cannot fit, it must still expand to the largest 4:3 size that can fit on the current screen rather than shrinking to an arbitrarily small fallback.
- Once the preview is visible it must become the active hot interaction surface so left/right arrows, Tab, mouse wheel scrolling, touchpad scrolling, Space, Shift+Space, Page Up, and Page Down all operate on the preview without requiring the user to chase the hover state.
- The top-right preview chrome must stay minimal: one compact hint chip only, showing icon-led guidance for left/right width stepping, `Tab`, and `(⇧+) Space`; it must not duplicate the hint in a separate native overlay, keep always-visible pixel-resolution text, or spell out verbose words such as “明暗” and “翻页”.
- Preview motion must feel smooth: showing, hiding, width-tier switching, and Tab-based background switching must animate rather than snap abruptly.
- The current motion spec for Layer 1 is: popup entrance about 270ms ease-in-out, popup exit about 210ms ease-in-out, width-tier transitions about 360ms ease-in-out, Markdown-to-Markdown content crossfade using about 210ms fade-out plus 270ms fade-in, and Tab background transitions using short CSS-level color/opacity easing rather than hard snaps.
- Width-tier switching must animate both the native window frame and a subtle content-surface transition so small-to-medium tier jumps do not read as hard snaps.
- Space, Shift+Space, Page Up, and Page Down paging must use sticky eased motion with visible acceleration/deceleration and a light settle, not an immediate jump.

## Closed-Loop End State

Layer 1 is done only when all of the following are true on the same machine:

1. FastMD launches as a menu bar app.
2. Finder is frontmost in list view.
3. Mouse hovers over a visible local `.md` file item for 1 second.
4. FastMD resolves the actually hovered Finder item to a real file path.
5. FastMD reads the file and renders readable preview content.
6. FastMD shows a floating preview panel near the cursor on the correct display.
7. Hovering onto a different `.md` replaces the existing preview without requiring a restart or manual reset.
8. The preview supports stepwise width changes across four tiers from its narrowest default width up to a 1920:1440 4:3 maximum tier, driven by left/right arrow hotkeys while the preview is hot.
9. Double-clicking a rendered block enters inline edit mode for that block's original Markdown source and saving returns to preview mode without corrupting surrounding content.
10. Once visible, the preview accepts scrolling and paging input directly from mouse wheel, touchpad, Space, Shift+Space, Page Up, and Page Down.
11. Showing, hiding, width changes, and Tab-based background changes animate smoothly enough to avoid jarring snaps.
12. Clicking outside the preview, switching apps, or pressing Escape closes the preview when the panel is not in edit mode.
13. The loop can be repeated across many files and across both internal and external displays without restarting the app.
